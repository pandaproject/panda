Default users
=============

For demonstration and configuration purposes and PANDA ships with two default users, one administrator and one ordinary PANDA user. You will use the default administrator account to create your own adminstrator account. We strongly recommend that you then delete the demo users.

The default accounts are::

    Administrator
    Username: panda@pandaproject.net
    Password: panda

::

    PANDA user
    Username: user@pandaproject.net
    Password: user

Creating a new admin user
=========================

Visit the admin users page::

    http://localhost:8000/admin/auth/user/

Replace ``localhost:8000`` with your PANDA's domain name.

When prompted to login use the default administrator credentials documented above.

In the upper-right corner click "Add user". Type in the email address and name and click "Save". If you've already setup `Email <email.html>`_ then you will receive a registration email with an activation link. Ignore it. On the details page for your new user click the "change password form" link underneath the **Password** field. Enter your password and click "Change Password". Check the **Active**, **Staff status** and **Superuser status** checkboxes and click "Save".

Log out and log back in with your new superuser. You may now uncheck the **Active** checkbox for the default administrator and click "Save".

Creating new PANDA users
========================

.. note::

    Setup `Email <email.html>`_ before you do this.

Visit the admin users page::

    http://localhost:8000/admin/auth/user/

Replace ``localhost:8000`` with your PANDA's domain name.

In the upper-right corner click "Add user". Type in the email address. You may choose to also enter the user's name or leave it blank. They will have an opportunity to add/update it. Click "Save". Your new user will receive a registration email with an activation link.

Creating new users in bulk
==========================

If you need to create a lot of users you can also use your administrative API key to create new users via the `API <api.rst>`_.
