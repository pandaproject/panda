====================
Upgrading your PANDA
====================

We have yet to settle on a definitive upgrade strategy for PANDA, but broadly speaking upgrades will proceed as follows:

When we release a new version (e.g. 1.1), we will also release an upgrade script that migrates the previous version (e.g. 1.0) forward. These scripts will be self-contained and function much like the `backup <backups.rst>`_ and `storage migration <storage.rst>`_ scripts. Each script will ensure that your data is securely migrated to the new version of the system.

We anticipate releasing more detailed instructions alongside our next release.
